The Python language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Python application using Docker. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- **Containerize and run a Python application**
- **Set up a local environment to develop a Python application using containers**
- **Lint, format, typing and best practices**
- **Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Python application using GitHub Actions**
- **Deploy your containerized Python application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment**

Start by containerizing an existing Python application.

## What you'll learn

By completing this guide, you will be able to:

- ‚úÖ Containerize Python applications (Flask & FastAPI)
- ‚úÖ Set up a local development environment with containers
- ‚úÖ Implement code quality best practices (linting, formatting, typing)
- ‚úÖ Configure automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Deploy and test applications locally using Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

- **Docker Desktop** - [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Python 3.9+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Git** - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Code Editor** - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

## How to use this guide

### üéØ Learning Path

Follow the modules sequentially for the best learning experience:

1. **Start with Module 1** - Learn containerization basics
2. **Progress through each module** - Build on previous knowledge
3. **Complete hands-on examples** - Practice with Flask and FastAPI
4. **Apply to your projects** - Use the patterns in real applications

### üåø Branch Structure

Each module has its own branch with complete examples and documentation:

```
main                     # This overview and navigation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module-01-containerize   # Dockerfiles and containerization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module-02-develop        # Local development setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module-03-linting-typing # Code quality and type safety
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module-04-cicd          # CI/CD with GitHub Actions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ module-05-deployment    # Kubernetes and testing
```

### üöÄ Quick Start

Ready to begin? Start with Module 1:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AndCarrillo/docker-python-guide.git
cd docker-python-guide

# Start with Module 1: Containerize your app
git checkout module-01-containerize

# Follow the README instructions in that branch
```

Each module branch contains:

- **üìö README.md** - Complete module guide with step-by-step instructions
- **üß© Examples** - Flask and FastAPI applications to practice with
- **üìñ Documentation** - Additional resources and troubleshooting

## Examples Overview

This guide uses **two progressive examples** throughout all modules:

| Example            | Framework | Purpose            | Key Concepts                                         |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flask Basic**    | Flask     | Learn fundamentals | Simple containerization, health checks, security     |
| **FastAPI Modern** | FastAPI   | Advanced patterns  | Multi-stage builds, async, documentation, production |

Both examples evolve through each module, teaching new Docker and development concepts while maintaining familiar application code.
